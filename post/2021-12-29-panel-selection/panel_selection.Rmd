## TL;DR

- In the social siences, we often encounter "left-censored" variables, where we have a big cluster at some lower threshold (often at zero).
- Selection bias means accidentally working with a specific subset of your audience instead of the whole. The fact that this subset was not drawn randomly, but according to some non-random "selection" process, renders your sample unrepresentative of the whole population.
- Statistical methods to correct for this selection bias are widely used in cross-sectional studies; most notably Heckman ([1978](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1909757) and [1979](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1912352)). They do, however, not easily extend to  longitudinal analysis with fixed effects due to the [incidental parameters problem](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-385-nonlinear-econometric-analysis-fall-2007/lecture-notes/lec21_22_nlpan.pdf) (see [Neyman & Scott, 1948](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914288)).
- [Semykina and Wooldridge (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407610000825) provide one estimator that controls for time-persistent, nonobserved heterogeneity (as fixed effects would) *and* corrects selection bias.
- In this post, I offer a crash course of the theory behind this estimator and implement it in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
