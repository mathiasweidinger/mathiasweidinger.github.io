Abstract
</summary>
In light of the growing climate and non-climate related
pressures on the global food system, this paper addresses three related questions:
To what extent do global food price shocks pass through to local markets, how
are these pass-throughs conditioned by country-level idiosyncrasies, and can
fiscal policy effectively support shock response and longer-term price
stabilisation? We estimate global-to-local food price pass-throughs in a
Bayesian VAR for most countries in the world using publicly available data
sources. To further investigate cross-dependencies in vulnerable countries,
our model is then extended to include multiple covariate shocks for the
Sub-Saharan African sub-sample. Decomposing food price shocks over time,
space, and contemporaneous oil price and harvest shocks, we construct fiscal
policy counterfactuals to evaluate hypothetical coping strategies.

Abstract
</summary>
Earth observation data has greatly enriched social science research, especially in contexts
where data is otherwise scarce or likely to suffer from measurement error. However,
social scientists may not have a good enough understanding of remote sensing
techniques to avoid unforeseen side effects when using this type of data. Economists
often combine gridded land cover data with survey data by reducing the former to locally
centred summary statistics at the interview locations provided by the latter. The
decisions taken in this reduction process can affect the resulting exposure metric and
subsequent statistical inference. Using interview locations in eleven African countries
from a large international survey, we calculate respondents' exposure to deforestation
in 108 slightly different ways. To illustrate how this can affect inference, we model
respondents' subjective well-being scores on the different versions of their exposure
to local deforestation in a multi-level, linear mixed model. We find significant negative
effects and insignificant effects depending on our parameter decisions. Finally, we
provide guidance and strategies for social scientists to consider when employing land
cover data.
