[{"content":" Let me set the scene. You find yourself studying graduate economics and are tasked to compile as much household expenditure data from low- and middle-income countries - or LMICs - as you can possibly muster.1 You think you are smart and immediately navigate to the World Bank’s Microdata Library to search, find, and download household expenditure data on countries from Algeria to Zimbabwe.2 Not long into your quest, however, you start to get side-tracked.\nThere are thousands of disparate data sets for the same country and year, data sets with similar names but different content, and all the while you must click back and forth through the myriads of variable descriptions to find out, whether expenditure was even captured by any of them (and if so, by which, and how was it measured…). Desperately, you resort to downloading and searching the surveys’ code books for clues. Not all of them are your friendly neighborhood searchable PDFs, though. To make matters worse, many are not written in English. Though you don’t speak the local language of where the survey was conducted, chances are you will soon find yourself scanning for matumizi, Pengeluaran, desembolso, or almasrufat (Yes, online translation is great; and no, you cannot afford to lose time learning Al-abjadiyah scripting). What began as a quick assignment takes up your entire afternoon and, as dusk sets in, you close your laptop in defeat and move on to your evening routine of Netflix and Chilll’d.\nIf you find this totally made-up thought experiment intriguing as well, there are two things I wanna tell you:\nI feel you. It’s okay.\n There is hope - at least for R users.\n  WBqueryR is my very first R-package. I made it to automate tedious queries like the ones described above from within R. Its main function WBqueryR::WBquery() takes user-defined search parameters and a list of keywords as input, downloads code books that meet the search criteria, and queries the variable labels in them for the presence of the keywords. It implements the following three steps:\nGather codebooks for (a subset of) all datasets listed in the Microdata Library, using the World Bank’s API.\n Score the variable labels (descriptions) in these codebooks for the presence of key words provided.\n Return a list of tibbles for variables with a matching score above the accuracy threshold.\n  Say you are interested in obtaining data on total consumption and expenditure for households in Nigeria, South Africa, or Vietnam. You are only interested in data that was collected between 2000 and 2019, and which is either in the public domain or else open access. Lastly, you want the results to match your key words at list by 60%. The example below queries the Microdata Library to find data that suits your needs:\nlibrary(WBqueryR) my_example \u0026lt;- WBquery( key = c(\u0026quot;total consumption\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;total expenditure\u0026quot;), # enter your keywords from = 2000, # lower time limit to = 2019, # upper time limit country = c(\u0026quot;nigeria\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;zaf\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;vnm\u0026quot;), # specify countries collection = c(\u0026quot;lsms\u0026quot;), # only look for lsms data access = c(\u0026quot;open\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;public\u0026quot;), # specify access accuracy = 0.6 # set accuracy to 60% )   Click to see output  #\u0026gt; gathering codebooks... #\u0026gt; scoring for key word 1/2 (total consumption)... #\u0026gt; scoring for key word 2/2 (total expenditure)... #\u0026gt; Search complete! Print results in the console? (type y for YES, n for NO):  When WBqueryR::WBquery() has completed the search, the user is prompted to decide, whether a summary of the search results should be printed in the console or not. Typing y into the console will print the summary, whereas n will not. Let us see what the summary looks like for the example above:\n#\u0026gt; Search complete! Print results in the console? (type y for YES, n for NO):y   Click to see output   #\u0026gt; 5 result(s) for --total consumption-- in 2 library item(s): #\u0026gt; NGA_2018_GHSP-W4_v03_M #\u0026gt; s7bq2b (CONSUMPTION UNIT) - 67% match #\u0026gt; s7bq2b_os (OTHER CONSUMPTION UNIT) - 63% match #\u0026gt; s7bq2c (CONSUMPTION SIZE) - 61% match #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; NGA_2015_GHSP-W3_v02_M #\u0026gt; totcons (Total consumption per capita) - 61% match #\u0026gt; totcons (Total consumption per capita) - 61% match #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; 3 result(s) for --total expenditure-- in 2 library item(s): #\u0026gt; NGA_2012_GHSP-W2_v02_M #\u0026gt; s2q19i (AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE) - 60% match #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; NGA_2010_GHSP-W1_v03_M #\u0026gt; s2aq23i (aggregate expenditure) - 61% match #\u0026gt; s2bq14i (aggregate expenditure) - 61% match  Note that no matter whether you choose to display the summary or not, all the information necessary to find the data later has been assigned to the new R-object my_example in your environment. This object is a list of 2 items - one for each key word - and each of these items includes tibbles of varying sizes that correspond to the datasets in the Microdata Library for which results have been found. Every tibble includes information on the matched variables: their name, label, and matching score.\nThe package’s installation and usage are described in more detail on the github repo where it lives. While it is far from perfect, I invite you to try out WBqueryR and, while you are at it, give feedback so we can improve it. Hopefully, it will save you some troubles next time you’re hunting for data.

While we might not have appreciated our parents’ persistence on the matter all too much back then (I sure did not), I think most people would agree - once they’re adults, that is - that it helped them with building good habits. Today’s post is a little bit like that parental insistence; a reminder to keep things tidy, or be it on our computers.\nMinimalism vs Organization\rA minimalist’s capsule wardrobe, perhaps.\n\rA few years ago, Marie Kondo - Japan’s “Queen of clean” - had become popular outside Japan and seemingly everyone had suddenly subscribed to some form of “minimalism” as a lifestyle choice. On youtube, minimalist content creators fed the (at times curious, at times outright bizarre) trend of listing everything they own (e.g. here and here), #minimalism trended on twitter, the capsule wardrobe took over instagram by storm, and even Netflix produced a full-length movie entitled The Minimalists: Less is Now. Although the trend went quite far for some of its proponents, the director of said movie, minimalism youtuber Matt D’avella, recently reminded his followers that “they didn’t have to marry a minimalist” to be good people. Reassuring!\nI, for my part, couldn’t wait to take this new-found panacea for all the world’s problems and apply it to my digital life. Devices like smart phones and computers are at the heart of most people’s professional as well as private lives and it is this constant exposure to them which makes me think that books like Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism deserve (at least) the same attention as the likes of Matt D’Avella or Marie Kondo. Not that there is anything wrong with decluttering the physical world around us - in fact, it has been eye-opening everytime I’ve done it.\nRather, I think that computers are a great place to experiment with structure. I have found that structure is the most useful tool when it comes to simplifying my life. At that, it is sometimes overlooked when we reduce minimalism to simply owning less stuff. It’s not only what we own (or how much of it), but also what we do with it - getting things done in other words. The way we assemble our possessions in the space around us affects how easily - and often - we will reach for and actually make use of them. Keeping things in an order that aligns well with our priorities and allows for easy and intuitive access is, thus, key to getting the most out of our belongings. Take for example a kitchen knive (I like to cook). You could of course store it anywhere, your garden shed or under your bed perhaps. But the fact that you will mostly need its services in the kitchen would make it a no-brainer to keep it in your kitchen drawer. Better yet, use a magnetic metal bar to “hang” it on your kitchen wall - in plain sight, that is. This choice maximises intuitive use, since the knive is always there when you need it, where you need it, if you need it. This can be applied to wardrobe organising, paper filing, and virtually all other life domains.\n\rFrom wardrobes to computers\rAbove I rambled about how organization - situating the right tools in the right place for their easy use - is key to simplifying one’s life. It’s also key to getting things done efficiently on your computer. Say you are working on a new project for work. For me, this usually involves the accumulation of code, documents, data, and many different sub-directories over time. In the past, I have found that chaos is inevitable if I let this folder and file structure grow “organically” as I go. The worst part about this is that it makes automation a hustle. You cannot easily loop through different folders, for instance, if the files in them are not named consistently or if they are spread across different sub directories in an arbitrary way. Why then have I often ended up in situation like this? Frankly, because building a good folder structure for a project ex ante can, itself, be time-consuming. What follows is the best solution I have come up with so far. It is far from perfect and I encourage you to experiment with it and share your strategies.\nRecently, I had to save, clean, and re-save household data for more than fifty countries. For each of them, I saved four different kinds of datasets for all the years available. In the end, the file and folder structure I was aiming for looked like this graph. First, find the ROOT/ folder. Then follow the arrows to explore the nested structure.\n\rFigure 1: An example of a project folder structure.\r\rThe ROOT/ folder includes a ROOT/country/ folder. In it are, in turn, two folders: raw and processed. ROOT/country/raw/ is where the original, unprocessed data goes initially. It is itself partitioned into folders, one for each of four types of data. The data wrangling and cleaning script(s) take data from there and output the processed datasets to ROOT/country/processed/, according again to the data types (1 thru 4). This is the clean data that enters my analysis.\n\rCan we bash it, already?\rAlright, to start with you need to know that the bash command to make new directories is conveniently called mkdir. To create a new folder called things on your desktop is as easy as writing…\ncd desktop\rmkdir things\rTo create a subdirectory inside things/ - let’s call it things/stuff/ - we could use the same principle: just cd into things/ and create the new sub-directory.\ncd desktop\rmkdir things\rcd things\rmkdir stuff\rThis is an example of the ad-hoc approach to creating a file system; everytime I feel like I need a subfolder inside a directory, I just go there, create it and place files in it. But this becomes cumbersome very fast, especially because one has to cd in and out directories all the time. Thankfully, there is a way to nest folders inside the mkdir command. The following lines create the same directory desktop/things/stuff/ as before, but this time in one line using the flag -p to allow for a nested structure.\ncd desktop\rmkdir -p things/stuff\rNext, let’s say that we want to divide our belongings into some things and other things, both of which consist of stuff and more stuff. For this, we use curly braces. Also make sure to use string delimiters (either ' or \") around directory names that include spaces.\ncd desktop\rmkdir -p {\u0026#39;some things\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;other things\u0026#39;}/{stuff,\u0026#39;more stuff\u0026#39;}\rWe just created a nested folder structure with multiple folders at each level. To see how truly powerful this simple command is, let’s finally create the project folder structure from figure 1. To up the complexity a little, the code below creates not one, not two…but fifty-five such country folders (named according to their two-letter country codes) inside the \\ROOT directory.\ncd ROOT # go to directory\rmkdir -p {al,am,bd,bj,bo,bf,bi,kh,ci,cm,cf,km,cg,eg,et,ga,gm,gh,gt,gn,gy,ht,hn,jo,kz,ke,kg,ls,lb,mg,mw,mv,ml,md,ma,mz,np,ni,ne,ng,pk,py,pe,rw,st,sn,sl,tz,tl,tg,tr,ug,ua,ye,zm,}/{processed,raw}/{type_1,type_2,type_3,type_4}\rThis works but it is rather messy to look at. If you need to access and rerun this several times, it might be wise to write a shell script and use \\ to allow commands to run over multiple lines in bash. Then you can also use # to add comments to your code.\ncd ROOT # go to directory\rmkdir -p {\\ # initiate mkdir\ral,am,bd,bj,bo,bf,bi,kh,ci,cm,cf,\\ # add country folders km,cg,eg,et,ga,gm,gh,gt,gn,gy,ht,\\ hn,jo,kz,ke,kg,ls,lb,mg,mw,mv,ml,\\\rmd,ma,mz,np,ni,ne,ng,pk,py,pe,rw,\\\rst,sn,sl,tz,tl,tg,tr,ug,ua,ye,zm,\\\r}\\\r/{processed,raw}\\ # create processed and raw sub-folders inside each country\r/{type_1,type_2,type_3,type_4} # divide them into data types\rLet’s rewind a bit. This one (admittedly long) command creates 55 folders, each of which contains two folders, each of which contains four folders. Multiply and you get 440 folders, embedded in a pre-defined and consistent structure. I don’t know about you, but I was awe-struck by that kind of efficiency.\nCoupled with a little planning ahead, you can now create usable nested project directories in the blink of an eye. Integrating a script like this to your computing routines can boost your productivity and makes it easier for others, who are unfamiliar with your folder structures, to replicate your work.\n\r","permalink":"http://mathiasweidinger.github.io/post/2021-12-13-directories-org/directories/","summary":"Remember the times when, as a kid, you were only allowed to go out to play if you had cleared up the chaos in your room first?

To scrutinise the economic rationales behind this practice in a dynamic setting, this paper develops an inter-temporal model of loan provision and tests the implications of blending in equilibrium. Blending provides optimal structuring of finance when the aim is to ease a project's credit constraints before it has achieved financial maturity. However, the benefits of blending subsequently decrease in an investment's private to public pay- off ratio and seize to exist entirely upon reaching maturity. Projects with significant externalities may never reach financial maturity, conditional on the extent to which commercial investors can monetise them. In these cases, grants and interest rate subsidies promise higher societal returns over the project's lifecycle.

WP coming soon\n  Abstract  In light of the growing climate and non-climate related pressures on the global food system, this paper addresses three related questions: To what extent do global food price shocks pass through to local markets, how are these pass-throughs conditioned by country-level idiosyncrasies, and can fiscal policy effectively support shock response and longer-term price stabilisation? We estimate global-to-local food price pass-throughs in a Bayesian VAR for most countries in the world using publicly available data sources. To further investigate cross-dependencies in vulnerable countries, our model is then extended to include multiple covariate shocks for the Sub-Saharan African sub-sample. Decomposing food price shocks over time, space, and contemporaneous oil price and harvest shocks, we construct fiscal policy counterfactuals to evaluate hypothetical coping strategies.   Exposure to Deforestation: How Robust is Statistical Inference to Choices in Land Cover Modelling? with Stafford Nichols and Stephan Dietrich. WP (pdf)\n  Abstract  Earth observation data has greatly enriched social science research, especially in contexts where data is otherwise scarce or likely to suffer from measurement error. However, social scientists may not have a good enough understanding of remote sensing techniques to avoid unforeseen side effects when using this type of data. Economists often combine gridded land cover data with survey data by reducing the former to locally centred summary statistics at the interview locations provided by the latter. The decisions taken in this reduction process can affect the resulting exposure metric and subsequent statistical inference. Using interview locations in eleven African countries from a large international survey, we calculate respondents' exposure to deforestation in 108 slightly different ways. To illustrate how this can affect inference, we model respondents' subjective well-being scores on the different versions of their exposure to local deforestation in a multi-level, linear mixed model. We find significant negative effects and insignificant effects depending on our parameter decisions. Finally, we provide guidance and strategies for social scientists to consider when employing land cover data.
