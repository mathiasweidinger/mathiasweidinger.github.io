[{"content":"Hello! I am a Research Assistant with the Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich. I study how to meaningfully measure people\u0026rsquo;s lived economic realities, including poverty and inequality, and how people\u0026rsquo;s livelihoods are affected by threats like armed conflict, disease or Climate Change.\nSome of my recent work includes estimating the impact of global warming on children\u0026rsquo;s labour supply in rural Nigeria, analyzing graduate student\u0026rsquo;s motives to switch specialization tracks, and comparing the long term benefits of early work with those of education throughout different economic environments. Holding a BA in European Studies, I have also worked on EU foreign affairs and polarized electoral contests.\nLarge data sets, spatial information and time trends are common to most of my projects. Therefore, I mostly code in R and occasionally dabble with Python and Julia. When I\u0026rsquo;m not working, you might find me running a trail, reading popular science books, watering my plants, or cooking with (and for) friends and family.\nBefore I came to Zurich, I was a Project Assistant at UNU-MERIT and studied at Maastricht University.\n","permalink":"http://example.org/about/","summary":"Hello!
