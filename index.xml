      <description>Remember the times when, as a kid, you were only allowed to go out to play if you had cleared up the chaos in your room first? While we might not have appreciated our parents’ persistence on the matter all too much back then (I sure did not), I think most people would agree - once they’re adults, that is - that it helped them with building good habits.</description>

      <description>Hello! I am a Research Assistant with the Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich. I study how to meaningfully measure people&amp;rsquo;s lived economic realities, including poverty and inequality, and how people&amp;rsquo;s livelihoods are affected by threats like armed conflict, disease or Climate Change.
Some of my recent work includes estimating the impact of global warming on children&amp;rsquo;s labour supply in rural Nigeria, analyzing graduate student&amp;rsquo;s motives to switch specialization tracks, and comparing the long term benefits of early work with those of education throughout different economic environments.</description>
