      <description>Hello! I am a Research Assistant with the Development Economics Group at ETH Zurich. I study how to meaningfully measure people&amp;rsquo;s lived economic realities, including poverty and inequality, and how people&amp;rsquo;s livelihoods are affected by threats like armed conflict, disease or Climate Change.
Some of my recent work includes estimating the impact of global warming on children&amp;rsquo;s labour supply in rural Nigeria, analyzing graduate student&amp;rsquo;s motives to switch specialization tracks, and comparing the long term benefits of early work with those of education throughout different economic environments.</description>
