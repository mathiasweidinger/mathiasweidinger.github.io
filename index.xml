      <description>Remember the times when, as a kid, you were only allowed to go out to play if you had cleared up the chaos in your room first? While we might not have appreciated our parents’ persistence on the matter all too much back then (I sure did not), I think most people would agree - once they’re adults, that is - that it helped them with building good habits.</description>

      <description>I am a data enthusiast and social scientist who lives at the intersection of environmental and development economics - or envirodevonomics for short. I study how people&amp;rsquo;s economic well-being relates to their natural surroundings, how economic activity transforms the natural environment, and how sustainable development can be achieved.
Most of the research I envision measures the effects of environmental threats on people&amp;rsquo;s livelihoods in the Global South (and vice versa). Since human development relies heavily on ecosystems services, the ultimate goal of my work is to find ways to tackle poverty, hunger, child mortality and the like through investment in environmental quality and effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.</description>
